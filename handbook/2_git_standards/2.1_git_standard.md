## 1.1 Git Flow

![WSE Git Flow](../docs/GitFlow.svg)

- Working on code repository(eg. `https://github.kyndryl.net/SST-WSE/handbook_web`) directly, It is not necessary to fork the repository to your personal namespace(eg. `https://github.kyndryl.net/yanleil/handbook_web`).

- Please use `feature/xxx` for our daily story development.

- Once the feature development is completed, please raise a `PR` from `feature/xxx` to branch `develop` instead of push code to `develop` directly. Once the `PR` raised, code will be deployed to `Dev` environment automaticly. Once the `PR` merged to `develop`, code will be deployed to `Test` environment automaticly.

- If you want to deploy code to `Prod` environment, please merge code from `develop` to `master` at first. Then, you can create a tag (`vx.x.x`, such as `v4.0.1`) based on `master`, when the tag created, the deploy request will be set to related approvers, once approved, code will be deployed to `Prod` environment automaticly.
